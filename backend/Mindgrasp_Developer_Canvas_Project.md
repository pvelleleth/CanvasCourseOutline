# Mindgrasp Developer Canvas Project

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**Deadline:** Thursday, February 27th, 2025  

### Project Overview  

**Objective:** Develop a Chrome extension that interfaces with Canvas LMS to retrieve and organize course structures. The output should be a JSON object, dynamically generated based on a schema created by AI, to accommodate the wide variability in how different instructors structure their courses. The focus is on retrieving course content and resources in a flexible, adaptable format.  

(Note: You do not need to create a polished user interface. This is more of a backend test)  

Feel free to leverage your resources, including AI tools like Cursor, Co-pilot, etc., and reach out to us if you have any questions throughout the project or get stuck.

## Key Features  

### 1. Canvas Integration  
- Extract course content, including modules, assignments, quizzes, and resources.  

### 2. AI-Generated Schema  
- The JSON object output will be dynamically built using a schema generated by AI. This schema will adapt to the varying structures teachers may use in organizing their courses.  
- The schema will identify key course components such as:  
  - **Modules** (e.g., Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions, Lectures)  
  - **Resources** (e.g., files, videos, URLs)  
  - **Metadata** (e.g., due dates, course names, and instructors)  

### 3. Data Output  
The extension will output a structured JSON object containing:  
- **Course information** (name, code, instructor)  
- **Course modules** organized by the AI schema (e.g., Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions)  
- **Downloadable resources** linked within the course (e.g., documents, videos)  
- **Dates and deadlines** for assignments and events, organized chronologically.  

### 4. Flexibility  
- The schema and corresponding data output must be adaptable to different course structures, as teachers may organize their courses in various ways.  
- The JSON object should reflect this flexible structure, ensuring that regardless of how a teacher organizes their class, the extension will generate an appropriate and accurate output.

## Acceptance Criteria  
- The extension generates a JSON object that reflects the dynamic course structure, with data categorized according to an AI-generated schema.  
- The JSON object includes course information, modules, dates, and downloadable resources.  
- The AI schema adapts to different course structures and accurately categorizes content.
